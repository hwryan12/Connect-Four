# Connect-Four
This pair-project was designed by breaking down the all aspects into their logical componets and use TDD to to implement functionality. Due to the nature of TDD, constant refactoring was a must as we developed this game.

## How To Play
The object of Connect Four is to place four of your tokens in consecutive order; whether it be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal placements. The first player to do so will be the winner. In this game you, the player, will be matched against a computer. The player's tokens will be marked by Xs while the computer's will be marked by Os.

To run the game, simply enter this prompt into your command terminal: `ruby lib/connect_four.rb`

We hope you enjoy our game!
